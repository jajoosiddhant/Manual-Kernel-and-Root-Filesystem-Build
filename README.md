# Manual-Kernel-and-Root-Filesystem-Build 


Execute the following commands to install crosstool-ng in the current working directory and then start the build for manual kernel. 
```
./crosstool-NG-install.sh
./manual_linux.sh

```
This will lead to qemu booting up.
You can find the hello-world example in the home directory to execute and test if the executable has been cross-compiled and executes inside qemu.
